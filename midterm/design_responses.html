								typographies appeal to different users. Look at other designers' works

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I like how this article breaks down the fundamentals of typography and 
								makes it easy to understand even for someone that is new to this field. 
								It uses pictures and works of established designers to demonstrate the 
								importance of typography in conveying purpose. I also like how it 
								incorporated a code section at the end that shows me how to compute 
								font sizes.
