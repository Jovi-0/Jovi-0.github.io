						<p> 1. First, open up the "Inspect" panel in your browser (right click -> "Inspect") 
                            and scroll through the contents in the "Console" tab. It should say that the New York 
                            Times is hiring. What is the link to their website where the New York Times is listing 
                            their open positions?</p>

						<p> 2. Next, let's dig around and take a look at their styling. 
                            What font does the New York Times use for their headings?</p>
						<p> Times </p>
					</li>

						<p> 3. Now, let's switch over to the "Elements" tab in "Inspect". 
                            Change three of their headlines to three things that happened to you today.</p>
						<p> I won a basketball game today. I made some spinach cheese quesadillas for lunch. I went to Whole Foods for some groceries.</p>

						<p> 4. Finally, take a screenshot of your browser and put it in your code submission. 
                            It should look something like this (with your own headlines, the logo should 
                            still say "The New York Times").</p>
