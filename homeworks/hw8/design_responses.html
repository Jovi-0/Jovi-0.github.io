					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> This article talks about how dark patterns are harmful to users' experience
							and also to the website/app/company's reputation. The article gives out 
							various examples of dark patterns like misdirecting and baiting that users 
							can be aware of. From this article, I learned that designers should have a moral 
							code in mind and try not to mislead users when designing. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> My favorite part of this artcile is that it raises awareness about 
							various methods of dark pattern and gives detailed examples for each. 
							Some of these examples are actually relevant to me since I've been 
							using these websites. After reading this article, I will be able to 
							notice when I was being manipulater by a website's interface. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> "As Campbell-Dollaghan (2017) stated, we are entering a new era where we shouldnâ€™t be using dark patterns as weapons to influence our world." </p>
