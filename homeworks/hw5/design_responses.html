                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> This article showed some UI interactions through the interfaces of phones 
                                and desktops. I realized that a lot of the designs utilized graphics and 
                                animation to make the interface more dynamic. These designs are really inspiring 
                                 as they show the huge possibilities of simple tools in web design. </p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite part of this article is the various examples of web design shown. 
                                The GIFs makes it possible for viewers to look at the dynamic user interactions. 
                                I also like how it incorporates design of different kinds of websites. </p>

                            <p> I lke the Sochnik work by Rynzhuk as it shows hover effects and transition 
                                effects as one clicks to an item. I also like the Radio Design work by Never-stop 
                                as it includes a lot of animation in its user interaction. I also like the use of color 
                                in the Norde work by Fedoseyev. I also like the use of neon color and wave animation in the 
                                Cryptocurrency work by Gal Shir as it really delivers the theme of crypto.</p>
