							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> This article taught me about Gestalt principles and how they can be used in interface. 
								It taught me how to communicate and interact with users to optimize their experience. 
								People perceive visuals in a particular way and recognizes patterns, and this should 
								be kept in mind when we are designing for users.
							 </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> What I like about this article is that it connects visual elements in design
								with psychology. Other than just explaining with words, it uses graphics to show 
								the Gestalt principles through interface design samples. I like how it helps me 
								have a bigger picture of how elements can be arranged to convey organization.
